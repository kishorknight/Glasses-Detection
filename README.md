# Glasses Detection Using Deep Learning

## Introduction
Glasses detection plays an important role in face recognition and soft biometrics for person identification. However, automatic glasses detection is still a challenging problem under real-world application 
scenarios due to variations in facial features, lighting conditions, and self-occlusion. These factors significantly influence the performance of detection models.

## Aim

The objective of this project is to create a deep learning algorithm that can differentiate between people wearing glasses and those without glasses based on facial analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of images classified into two categories:

- With Glasses

- Without Glasses

## Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing & Visualization

  - Display sample images from both classes.
  
  - Perform image augmentation to enhance the dataset and improve model generalization.

2. Model Building with CNN

  - Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images.
  
  - Explain the architecture of CNN, including: Convolutional layers, Pooling layers, Fully connected layers, Activation functions, Dropout layers
  
3. Hyperparameter Tuning

  - Analyze the impact of different hyperparameters on model performance, such as: Number of epochs, Batch size, Learning rate

4. Training & Evaluation

- Train the CNN model on the dataset.

- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrices.

## Conclusion

The developed CNN model effectively distinguishes between individuals with and without glasses, achieving high accuracy. The use of data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning has helped in enhancing model 
performance. Future improvements can include experimenting with deeper architectures and transfer learning for better generalization.
